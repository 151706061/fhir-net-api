## This is the support API for working with HL7's FhirPath extraction language.

Note that this library cannot be used independently and requires an actual implementation datamodel (i.e. FHIR's datamodel) to be able to use it.  It's being referenced and used by [the FHIR API](https://github.com/ewoutkramer/fhir-net-api) to implement FhirPath within the FHIR API.
